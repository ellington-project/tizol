// The Spectrogram struct is Tizol's core, and only, data structure. It stores the raw spectrogram data, as well as the dimensions of the computed spectrogram. The user should only construct a spectrogram via the methods `from_file`, and `from_buffer`, but the implementation details are left public, as they should be accesible for reading.
